# Snowflake Developer CLI

**Note**: Snowflake CLI is in Private Preview (PrPr). You must register for the PrPr to use Snowflake CLI by filling out the
[Snowflake CLI  - PrPr Intake Form](https://forms.gle/HZNhPNbzn7oExjFu8). Also, if you want to access Snowflake Container
Services through Snowflake CLI, you must register for its PrPr. For more information, you can contact a
Snowflake sales representative.

For complete installation and usage instructions, refer to the
[Snowflake CLI Guide](https://docs.snowflake.com/LIMITEDACCESS/snowcli/snowcli-guide).
